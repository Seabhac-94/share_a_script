# Share a Script

Share a Script is a project done under the requirements for MS3 Project - Data-Centric-Development w/Code Institute.
<br>
The idea for Share a Script was orignally conceived in June 2019. The intention of this site is to provide up-and-coming writers with a platform to share their work and have it critiqued by other authors.

## UX

#### Design Considerations
1. Background: A stack of books. Simple, yet to the point. Writing is an art, and the website should mirror that. This particular photo was chosen for it's classic approach to books.
2. Icons - Three main icons have been chosen for this site, a feather, scroll, and home, each clearly identifying the purpose, of writing, reading and returning to the home page. Simple and easy to understand.

## Features

The following features have been implemented already:

#### Existing Features
1. User Registration: User's who wish to submit their work to the site will have to register first. This is done using Flask, Bcrypt and MongoDB as the database for users.
2. User Login: As above. Registered users must login before attempting to share work on the site.
3. User Logout: Enables the user to end the session.
4. Navbars: The navbars are designed to change depending on whether or not users are logged in or not.
5. Share Your Story: Once users are logged in they will have access to the Share Your Story form. This form will give the user an option of inputing Author's First and Last Name - this part of the form in particular is important as it gives the user an option of giving a psuedo-name or "Anonymous".

#### Possible Future Features 
1. Comments section: Give other users the ability to comment/critique on others work.
