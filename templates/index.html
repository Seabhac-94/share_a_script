                    Writing has always been my passion, and using Share a Script, I was able to share that passion,
                    secure a book deal, and now get to write for a living! It gave me a platform to express
                    my work with the world.</p>

        <h5 class="main-heading">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - Chapter One</h5>
        <p class="second-font">2. It was 7 minutes after midnight. The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs. Shears's house. Its eyes were closed. It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not running or asleep. The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog. The points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen over. I decided that the dog was probably killed with the fork because I could not see any other wounds in the dog and I do not think you would stick a garden fork into a dog after it had died for some other reason, like cancer, for example, or a road accident. <a href="{{url_for('view_scripts')}}">Read More</a></p>

        <h5 class="main-heading">The Confession - The Crime - Chapter One</h5>
        <p class="second-font">The custodian at St. Mark's had just scraped three inches of snow off the sidewalks when the man with the cane appeared. The sun was up, but the winds were howling; the temperature was stuck at the freezing mark. The man wore only a pair of thin dungarees, a summer shirt, well-worn hiking boots, and a light Windbreaker that stood little chance against the chill. But he did not appear to be uncomfortable, nor was he in a hurry. He was on foot, walking with a limp and a slight tilt to his left, the side aided by the cane. He shuffled along the sidewalk near the chapel and stopped at a side door with the word "Office" painted in dark red. He did not knock and the door was not locked. <a href="{{url_for('view_scripts')}}">Read More</a></p>
