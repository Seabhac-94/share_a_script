            <p class="second-font">2. It was 7 minutes after midnight. The dog was lying on the grass in the middle
                of the lawn in front of Mrs. Shears's house. Its eyes were closed. It looked as if it was running on
                its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not
                running or asleep. The dog was dead. <a href="{{url_for('view_scripts')}}">Read More</a>

            <p class="second-font">The custodian at St. Mark's had just scraped three inches of snow off the sidewalks
                when the man with the cane appeared. The sun was up, but the winds were howling; the temperature was
                stuck at the freezing mark. The man wore only a pair of thin dungarees, a summer shirt, well-worn hiking
                boots, and a light Windbreaker that stood little chance against the chill. But he did not appear to be
                uncomfortable, nor was he in a hurry. He was on foot, walking with a limp and a slight tilt to his left,
                the side aided by the cane. He shuffled along the sidewalk near the chapel and stopped at a side door
                with the word "Office" painted in dark red. He did not knock and the door was not locked. <a
